 * Exact-byte SHA-256 hashing for pin currency (pinning-2, pinning-3; DR-007).

 * Hashes are SHA-256 over the exact file bytes — with no line-ending or other
 * text normalization — written as `sha256:` followed by 64 lowercase hexadecimal
 * characters. This is the conservative identity the pin validator compares
 * recorded hashes against, so any byte difference (including a line-ending

 * `execution.ts` keeps its own raw-hex helper; this module owns the pin format.

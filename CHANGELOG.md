## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Agent-executed Markdown phase pipelines with deterministic chaining,
  configuration discovery, and Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode
  adapters.
- Self-hosted compiled phase execution with reviewed artifacts, exact-byte
  pins, dependency closure hashing, and fail-closed provenance selection.
- The `playbook` compiler pipeline from prose through normalization, GEARS,
  XState FSM, optimization, linked runtime, registry entry, and generated
  verification suites.
- Project-local configuration seeding and an English two-agent review-loop
  reference compile.

### Fixed

- Bound runtime-resolved player IDs back to source-declared role IDs.
- Preserved nullish Playbook host-port rejections as control-plane failures.
- Made demo repository-root initialization safe inside a containing checkout.
- Rejected unrelated shared-engine imports as pinned runtime factories.

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- An installed-package runtime smoke in the release checks — one Boss turn
  driven from a scratch consumer over fake host ports — and an opt-in
  `test:acceptance` gate that packs the candidate, compiles a minimal
  workflow with a real coding agent, runs the freshly compiled playbook
  with real agents, and verifies the repaired sample by compiling it.
- A self-contained `demo/` npm project with a contained, version-aligned
  install, and the Chinese demo reference set compiled through the pinned
  compiled pipeline — the same provenance as the English reference — with
  the demo checker now asserting the Boss task text reaches the first
  player prompt in both languages.

### Changed

- **Adopted Playbook 3.1.0 as one reviewed unit.** Exact
  `@sublang/playbook@3.1.0` link-target provenance selects the composed
  six-port profile (its `runtime.ts` is byte-identical to 2.0.0; 1.3.0 and
  3.0.0 stay fail-closed); the vendored `link.md` re-syncs the hardened
  judge-prompt envelope and `spec.compat` stamping; all three meta-phase
  bundles are rebuilt from the synced definitions, so artifacts compiled by
  the vendored pipeline now declare their runtime compatibility and fail
  fast on a mismatched engine; every pin regenerates with 3.1.0 provenance.
- **The documented consumption model is global-first.** Playbook 3.1
  provisions its own engine beside a filesystem artifact whose imports do
  not resolve, so the README leads with `npm install -g` and bare CLI
  invocations; a project's own install remains authoritative wherever it
  resolves, and the build now clears generated output before compiling so a
  superseded artifact cannot reach the tarball.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Agent-executed Markdown phase pipelines with deterministic chaining,
  configuration discovery, and Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode
  adapters.
- Self-hosted compiled phase execution with reviewed artifacts, exact-byte
  pins, dependency closure hashing, and fail-closed provenance selection.
- The `playbook` compiler pipeline from prose through normalization, GEARS,
  XState FSM, optimization, linked runtime, registry entry, and generated
  verification suites.
- Project-local configuration seeding and an English two-agent review-loop
  reference compile.
- CI-gated npm publication with provenance: an interactive first publication
  by a maintainer, then token-free OIDC for every later release.

### Fixed

- Bound runtime-resolved player IDs back to source-declared role IDs.
- Preserved nullish Playbook host-port rejections as control-plane failures.
- Made demo repository-root initialization safe inside a containing checkout.
- Rejected unrelated shared-engine imports as pinned runtime factories.

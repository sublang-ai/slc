# Text-to-GEARS Transformation

First phase of a playbook (a state-machine agent orchestrating other agents).
Transforms a user's procedure description into normative GEARS [[1]] spec items.

- Source: free-form natural-language description.
- Target: a package of GEARS spec items.

The second phase (spec items → state machine) is out of scope.

## Formats

| Role | Format | Extension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| source | text | .md |
| target | gears | .md |

## Pin Inputs

- `../../specs/meta.md`
- `../../specs/decisions/000-spec-structure-format.md`
- `../../package-lock.json`

## Players

Players name AI agents and the user.

Two default players:

- Boss: the human user
- Captain: the coordinating agent

Source may declare additional players in an opening `Players:` section.
A player may alias other players with `=` and `|`; Boss picks one at runtime.
E.g.:

- Coder
- Reviewer
- Committer = Coder | Reviewer

Capitalize English player names (e.g., `Writer`); quote non-English names (e.g., `作者`) when needed to distinguish from prose.

## Behaviors

Each spec item names a condition, the player to prompt, and the prompt itself.
Prompts shall be blockquoted, one point per line.

E.g.:

```markdown
### CODE-10

When Reviewer is about to review any change, Captain shall prompt Reviewer:
> Flag any issues or improvements (numbered; no duplication).
> Think thoroughly — don't just approve or reject.
> If the change is ready to commit or push, don't raise nitpicks.
> Do not edit files or commit; report findings only.
```

Target should be written in the same language as Source.

## Transformation-spec sources

A Source may itself be the normative specification of a transformation — e.g., a compiler phase definition, as when a meta pipeline compiles this file.
Such a Source declares no players and prompts none; its implied procedure is that Captain performs the specified transformation on request.
Compose Captain-acting spec items for it: when a transformation request names the specification's source and target, Captain shall carry out the transformation as specified.
Prompts shall carry the specification's normative requirements as instructions to Captain — deduplicated, one point per line — without inventing players, triggers, or requirements the specification does not state.

## Composition

Source snippets may overlap or duplicate.
When composing them into a spec item, text2gears shall deduplicate identical prompt lines.

Each spec item addresses one state behavior and carries its full final prompt (the static part).
Cross-item duplication is acceptable: spec items are compiled artifacts; Source is what users maintain.

Test: a human shall be able to simulate a run by copying any single item's prompt verbatim — no cross-item composition needed.

### Placeholders vs literals

Use `<placeholder>` for dynamic values in blockquoted prompts.
Everything else inside a blockquote is static text, not an example; examples belong in surrounding prose.

Markdown escaping is Source syntax, not content: extraction shall resolve escapes (e.g. `\<placeholder\>` becomes `<placeholder>`), so compiled artifacts carry plain text.

### Split by content discriminator

Partition items by every variable that determines prompt content — including accumulated state when the trigger alone doesn't.

### Prune dead disjuncts

Drop disjunctive branches incompatible with the rest of an item's condition or prompt.
Dead branches mislead readers and downstream phases.

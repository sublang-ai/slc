# FSM-to-Runtime Linking

Third phase of a playbook (a state-machine agent orchestrating other agents).
Compiles the [gears2fsm](gears2fsm.md) artifact into a **`PlaybookRuntime`**: a host-agnostic runner that:

- Drives the FSM.
- Classifies Boss input into typed events.
- Runs direct-Captain, delegated-player, and nested-playbook actors.
- Executes deterministic script actors locally, without any agent.
- Adjudicates Captain and player output into FSM guards.
- Surfaces transitions as status/telemetry.

The runtime is invoked through the stable `PlaybookPorts` contract.
Presentation layers (tmux-play, web, CLI, tests) implement the six ports once
and inherit every playbook.

- Source: an XState v5 machine artifact (`.fsm.ts`) produced by gears2fsm.
- Target: a `PlaybookRuntime` factory module — TypeScript, host-agnostic.

Hosts are out of scope for this phase.
Each host has an adapter that loads a `PlaybookRuntime` module and supplies the host's primitives as `PlaybookPorts`.
The adapter shall speak only `PlaybookPorts` to the runtime and shall not leak host types back into it.

The link compiler shall not modify the FSM artifact and shall not re-derive Captain prompts, result keys, or guard semantics — those are fixed by the FSM.

## Formats

| Role   | Format   | Extension |
| ------ | -------- | --------- |
| source | fsm      | .ts       |
| target | playbook | .ts       |

## Pin Inputs

- `text2gears.md`
- `gears2fsm.md`
- `../../package-lock.json`

## PlaybookRuntime contract

The emitted module shall default-export a factory of the following shape:

```typescript
interface PlaybookRuntime {
  init(session: PlaybookSession): Promise<void>;
  handleBossInput(turn: {
    text: string;
    signal: AbortSignal;
  }): Promise<PlaybookRunResult>;
  resumePlaybookCall(input: {
    callId: string;
    result: PlaybookCallResult;
    signal: AbortSignal;
  }): Promise<PlaybookRunResult>;
  dispose(): Promise<void>;
}

interface PlaybookSession {
  sessionId: string;
  playbookId: string;
  rootSessionId: string;
  parentSessionId?: string;
  parentCallId?: string;
  depth: number;
  ports: PlaybookPorts;
}

type JsonValue =
  | null
  | boolean
  | number
  | string
  | readonly JsonValue[]
  | { readonly [key: string]: JsonValue };

interface NormalizedError {
  name: string;
  message: string;
  stack?: string;
}

type PlaybookStateValue =
  | string
  | { readonly [key: string]: PlaybookStateValue };

interface PlaybookState {
  value: PlaybookStateValue;
  activeStateIds: readonly string[];
  tags: readonly string[];
  status: 'active' | 'done' | 'error' | 'stopped';
  quiescent: boolean;
  stateId?: string;
}

interface PlaybookPendingCall {
  callId: string;
  playbookId: string;
  childSessionId: string;
}

type PlaybookRunResult =
  | { outcome: 'quiescent' | 'no-action'; state: PlaybookState }
  | {
      outcome: 'failed' | 'aborted';
      state: PlaybookState;
      error?: NormalizedError;
    }
  | {
      outcome: 'terminal';
      state: PlaybookState;
      output?: JsonValue;
    }
  | {
      outcome: 'suspended';
      state: PlaybookState;
      pendingCall: PlaybookPendingCall;
    };

type PlaybookRuntimeFactory<Options = unknown> = (
  options: Options,
) => PlaybookRuntime;

export default function createPlaybookRuntime(
  options: PlaybookRuntimeOptions,
): PlaybookRuntime;
```

The default export conforms to `PlaybookRuntimeFactory<PlaybookRuntimeOptions>`, the generic factory type the shared contract module exposes (§Output).

`init` receives the host-owned playbook session identity and ports, constructs the XState actor with FSM `input` derived from `options`, and starts the actor.
The runtime owns the actor for its lifetime; `handleBossInput` runs one turn, and `dispose` stops the actor and drains pending port emissions.
The host shall generate a non-empty, globally unique `sessionId` for each init-to-dispose lifecycle and shall supply the stable registry or authored playbook id as `playbookId`.
The runtime shall validate non-empty session, playbook, and root ids, a safe
non-negative integer depth, root identity (`depth === 0` and
`rootSessionId === sessionId` with no parent fields), and child identity
(`depth > 0` with non-empty parent session and call ids). It shall copy those
identity scalars and the port references into its own immutable record rather
than retaining the caller's mutable session object. A child `sessionId` shall
differ from both its `rootSessionId` and `parentSessionId`.

Run outcomes are exact: `no-action` means no FSM event was sent;
`quiescent` means a non-failure parked/idle state; `failed` means the FSM is in
a recoverable failure state; `terminal` means top-level final with optional
JSON output; `aborted` means the turn signal ended work; and `suspended` means
exactly one `pendingCall` is active.
Control-plane exceptions reject the runtime method rather than masquerade as a
recoverable workflow `failed` result.

`PlaybookRuntimeOptions` is host-agnostic and carries only _per-run_ knobs such as identity strings (e.g., model names a playbook substitutes into prompt placeholders) and strategy overrides the linker exposes.
The link compiler emits a typed options interface per playbook based on the FSM's `CodingInput` (or equivalent).
The CLI's absence of `--link-option` values does not mean that
`PlaybookRuntimeOptions` is empty. CLI link options are compile-time inputs;
the runtime options interface is independently derived from every required FSM
input field that is not supplied by `PlaybookSession` or another linker-owned
source. In particular, a required immutable `enabledPlaybooks` catalog shall
remain a required readonly runtime option passed through to machine input; the
linker shall neither invent an empty catalog nor require it to be baked into a
CLI link option.

Player binding is a _linker-time_ input baked into the emitted runtime by default.
A linker may also expose it via `PlaybookRuntimeOptions` for per-run remapping; the contract requires only that the runtime ship with a deterministic binding it applies at every `callPlayer` site.

## PlaybookPorts contract

```typescript
interface PlaybookPorts {
  callPlayer(
    playerId: string,
    prompt: string,
    signal: AbortSignal,
    options: PlayerCallOptions,
  ): Promise<PlayerResult>;
  callCaptain(
    prompt: string,
    signal: AbortSignal,
    options: CaptainCallOptions,
  ): Promise<CaptainResult>;
  callJudge(prompt: string, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<string>;
  callPlaybook(
    request: PlaybookCallRequest,
    signal: AbortSignal,
  ): Promise<PlaybookCallStart>;
  emitStatus(message: string, data?: unknown): Promise<void>;
  emitTelemetry(event: { topic: string; payload: unknown }): Promise<void>;
}

interface PlayerCallOptions {
  resume: string | false;
}

interface CaptainCallOptions {
  visibility: 'visible' | 'hidden';
  resume: string | false;
  allowedTools: readonly string[];
}

interface PlayerResult {
  status: 'ok' | 'aborted' | 'error';
  resumeToken?: string;
  finalText?: string;
  error?: string;
}

interface CaptainResult {
  status: 'ok' | 'aborted' | 'error';
  finalText?: string;
  error?: string;
}

interface PlaybookCallRequest {
  callId: string;
  playbookId: string;
  text: string;
}

type PlaybookCallResult =
  | {
      status: 'ok';
      playbookId: string;
      childSessionId: string;
      state?: PlaybookState;
      output?: JsonValue;
    }
  | {
      status: 'aborted';
      playbookId: string;
      childSessionId?: string;
      state?: PlaybookState;
      error?: NormalizedError;
    }
  | {
      status: 'error';
      playbookId: string;
      childSessionId?: string;
      state?: PlaybookState;
      error: NormalizedError;
    };

type PlaybookCallStart =
  | { state: 'settled'; result: PlaybookCallResult }
  | { state: 'suspended'; childSessionId: string };
```

`PlayerResult` mirrors the status, resume token, final text, and error fields of cligent's `PlayerRunResult` ([TMUX-033](https://github.com/sublang-ai/cligent/blob/main/specs/user/tmux-play.md#tmux-033)).
The runtime treats `status !== 'ok'` as a player failure and routes it through the FSM's error path (§Abort).

`callCaptain` runs a direct-Captain FSM actor against the host's Captain
agent. The linked runtime shall pass
`{ visibility: 'visible', resume: false }` for authored workflow calls so
XState context, rather than an agent conversation, owns workflow continuity.
The tool restriction is source-owned: the runtime shall additionally pass
`allowedTools: []` exactly when the GEARS source itself restricts the acting
Captain from tools (a routing-only Captain policy such as the default generic
Captain). A transformation-performing Captain — e.g. a compiler phase compiled
from a transformation-spec source, whose behavior writes a declared target
artifact — works through the host Captain's own tools, so its calls shall
carry no `allowedTools` restriction.
`CaptainResult` carries no resume token or player-continuation selection.
A non-`ok`
result, or an `ok` result without `finalText`, shall reject the actor through
the FSM's error path.
Outside a signal-driven abort, those invalid direct-Captain results are
latched control-plane failures. The runtime shall let the actor take `onError`,
drive it to quiescence, and drain ordered emissions before the public method
rejects with the original failure. It shall never translate either case into
a recoverable workflow `{ outcome: 'failed' }` result. If the combined signal
has aborted, an aborted host result follows the ordinary abort settlement
instead of being promoted to a control-plane failure.

Every linked runtime owns a map from resolved player id to its latest non-empty `resumeToken`.
Before reading a resolved direct-Captain or delegated-player result, the
runtime shall validate, detach, and freeze it through the shared
`validateCaptainResult` or `validatePlayerResult` helper. The accepted object
shape is exact: only the declared status and optional string fields are
allowed, JSON-unsafe members reject, and caller mutation after resolution
cannot change trace evidence or player continuity. Validation happens before
adopting a resume token or reading final text.
The first call to each player in a playbook session shall pass `{ resume: false }`; later calls shall pass the exact stored token.
After a resolved call, the runtime shall replace the token when the result carries one or clear it when absent before interpreting `status`; a rejected call with no result leaves the prior token unchanged.
After awaiting a host Captain or player promise, the runtime shall re-check the
combined invocation/public-boundary signal before validating the result,
adopting a resume token, or emitting a successful finish. A host promise that
ignores cancellation and resolves late shall be paired as aborted and shall
not mutate continuity or masquerade as success.
The map survives actor reconstruction inside the same runtime and is discarded at `dispose`.
The runtime shall keep an in-flight set keyed by resolved player id and reject
a second concurrent call to the same id before crossing the host port. Calls
to distinct resolved player ids may overlap.

`callJudge` returns free-form text.
The runtime parses it per the state's adjudication strategy (§Captain adjudication).
One port serves both classifier and adjudicator — they vary only in prompt.
Concurrent `callJudge` attempts within one linked runtime shall pass through
one abort-aware local FIFO. After the host promise resolves, the runtime shall
require a string reply and re-check the combined signal before tracing or
parsing success, so a non-cooperative late judge cannot outlive cancellation.
The host shall serialize `callCaptain` and `callJudge` together through one
shared abort-aware concurrency-one FIFO because both use the same single-flight
Captain lane, even when distinct player ports overlap [[4]]. A direct Captain
call's subsequent adjudication shall enter that same queue only after the
visible call has settled; the linked runtime shall not hold one queue lease
while requesting the other port.
Use one shared `PQueue({ concurrency: 1 })` for the individual host
`callCaptain` and `callJudge` promises. Do not pass an invocation or public
boundary signal as `PQueue.add(..., { signal })`: PQueue may release a running
slot as soon as that signal aborts even though a non-cooperative host promise
is still executing, which permits overlap. Instead check the combined signal
inside the queued task before crossing the host port, await the host promise
without releasing the queue lease, and check the signal again afterward.

`callPlaybook` starts a function-style child call.
The caller runtime supplies its stable call id and the XState invocation's
lifetime signal.
The host drives the child's initial text before resolving the port with either
an immediate settled result or a suspended child session.
Suspension is resumed later through `PlaybookRuntime.resumePlaybookCall`; the
port promise itself shall not remain pending across Boss turns.

`emitStatus` is human-readable; `emitTelemetry` is structured.
Both are async and shall be ordered, awaited, and never-dropped; the runtime awaits each emission before issuing the next.

The runtime never speaks to LLMs directly and never touches host types beyond `PlaybookPorts`.

## Playbook trace

Every linked runtime shall emit a boundary-complete, ordered trace through `emitTelemetry` topic `playbook.trace`.
Each payload shall carry `schemaVersion: 2`, the immutable session identity and
causality, a contiguous one-based `sequence`, a Unix-millisecond `timestamp`, a
trace `type`, event `payload`, and the runtime-local `turnId` / paired `callId`
where applicable.

```typescript
type PlaybookTraceType =
  | 'session.started'
  | 'boss.input.received'
  | 'judge.call.started'
  | 'judge.call.finished'
  | 'player.call.started'
  | 'player.call.finished'
  | 'captain.call.started'
  | 'captain.call.finished'
  | 'playbook.call.started'
  | 'playbook.call.finished'
  | 'fsm.transition'
  | 'status.emitted'
  | 'boss.input.settled'
  | 'session.disposed';

interface PlaybookTraceEvent {
  schemaVersion: 2;
  sessionId: string;
  playbookId: string;
  rootSessionId: string;
  parentSessionId?: string;
  parentCallId?: string;
  depth: number;
  sequence: number;
  timestamp: number;
  type: PlaybookTraceType;
  turnId?: number;
  callId?: string;
  payload: JsonValue;
}
```

The trace types are `session.started`, `boss.input.received`,
`judge.call.started`, `judge.call.finished`, `player.call.started`,
`player.call.finished`, `captain.call.started`, `captain.call.finished`,
`playbook.call.started`,
`playbook.call.finished`, `fsm.transition`, `status.emitted`,
`boss.input.settled`, and `session.disposed`.
Call pairs carry exact prompts and replies, normalized failures, actor and state
identity, and their boundary-specific options.
`session.started` and `session.disposed` carry their descriptor as top-level
`state` and its singular `stateId` when present. Every judge start and finish
carries the working snapshot's singular `stateId` when one exists;
classification uses the current descriptor and adjudication uses the invoking
actor input. The default Captain always has such a singular id, while a
parallel snapshot may omit it. Every judge finish also carries
`status: 'ok' | 'aborted' | 'error'`. Every `status.emitted` carries the
described top-level `state` and its singular `stateId` when present, as well as
its message and optional data; consumers shall not have to recover state
identity from a nested ad hoc object.
Judge results use `reply`; player start and finish payloads both carry the
selected `resume`; Captain start and finish payloads both carry
the exact composed prompt, `visibility: 'visible'`, the direct invocation's
`stateId` and `sourceItem`, and no player resume selection or resume token;
judge `purpose` is
`boss-input-classification`, `player-output-adjudication`, or
`captain-output-adjudication`; and every error uses
`{ name, message, stack? }` rather than a raw string or `Error` instance.
The Captain finish payload shall preserve the exact `CaptainResult` status and
final text when present, while carrying any failure in normalized form.
An `ok` result without `finalText` therefore retains status `ok` but also
carries the normalized missing-text failure that makes the actor reject.
If the Captain port rejects before returning a result, the finish instead
carries explicit `status: 'aborted'` when the combined signal has aborted or
`status: 'error'` otherwise. A finish boundary never omits status merely
because there was no structured host result.
The pair obligation also applies when a port promise rejects or throws: the
linked runtime shall emit and drain one normalized finish boundary before it
propagates the failure. No started call boundary may be left without its
matching finished boundary.
If a started-boundary sink records the event and then rejects, the runtime
shall make one best-effort normalized error-finish attempt with the same call
id and then reject the original start error. It shall not retry either event or
let a failure of that finish attempt replace the start error.
When a call boundary carries `callId`, that id shall be unique within the
runtime session. A stable FSM `stateId` is identity metadata in the payload,
not a call id and shall not be reused as one across repeated invocations.
Optional trace and run-result members shall be omitted when absent; the runtime
shall not create own `turnId`, `callId`, parent identity, output, or error
properties with value `undefined` and then rely on JSON serialization to drop
them.
A `boss.input.settled` payload shall project the complete structured run
result: its outcome must be one of the `PlaybookRunResult` discriminants (never
an invented `error` outcome), and it shall include `state`, singular
`stateId`, `pendingCall`, `output`, and normalized `error` whenever the matching
result arm carries them.
One runtime-owned concurrency-one emission queue shall serialize every trace,
human status, and state telemetry call. Sequence allocation and enqueueing
shall occur atomically, and every public method shall drain that queue before
resolving or rejecting. A state transition emission queued on entry shall be
observed before the invoked boundary's `*.started` event, even when a host
delays `emitTelemetry`.
The linked module shall use `PQueue({ concurrency: 1 })` from `p-queue` for
this ordering and drain it with `onIdle()` rather than recreate a promise-queue
implementation in every generated artifact.
An XState inspection callback shall synchronously enqueue the transition
trace, state telemetry, status trace, and human status in that order before it
returns. `emitStatus` likewise enqueues its trace and port emission in the same
synchronous call. Do not enqueue state telemetry or the status port from a
`trace(...).then(...)` continuation: the queue can become momentarily idle,
letting an invoked actor's `await drain()` overtake those dependent enqueues.
All validation happens before these synchronous enqueues; later sink failures
are caught into the appropriate latch without changing their queue position.
FSM trace events carry the same transition, pending-question, and normalized-error fields as state telemetry.
Trace emissions are awaited and sequenced before the boundary operation or human status/state telemetry they describe.
Every event in one session carries the same root/parent/depth identity.
A parent call start precedes its child `session.started`; the child's
`session.disposed` precedes the parent call finish.
Parallel call finishes may occur in either order, so consumers shall use call
ids for pairing and sequence for the observed total order.

This trace covers everything observable through `PlaybookRuntime`; host-specific adapter streaming remains in the host record stream.
Trace payloads never become Boss-visible status or prompt text.

## Linker inputs

The link compiler shall accept:

- The FSM artifact (path to a `.fsm.ts`).
- A **player binding** mapping GEARS players (declared in the
  [text2gears](text2gears.md#players) source) to opaque player-identifier
  strings.
  Where no binding is supplied, the linker shall apply the default
  binding — each player to its lowercased name (e.g. `Coder` → `coder`)
  — and record the applied binding in the emitted header.
- An **adjudication strategy** (default: LLM-judge per state) and a
  **Boss-event mapping** (default: free-text judge classification).
  Both strategies are host-agnostic.

The host's identity does not enter compilation; the linked module runs unchanged under any host that implements `PlaybookPorts`.

## Player binding

Each delegated GEARS state names exactly one player
(`player` actor `invoke.input.player`).
The linker shall map every named player to a `playerId` string used in
`PlaybookPorts.callPlayer(playerId, …)`.
The host adapter routes that opaque string to its concrete primitive.
Every direct-Captain and delegated-player invocation shall also carry its
working leaf's explicit
`stateId`; a linked runtime shall use that field for call identity and shall
not infer one leaf from a structured root snapshot.
Direct `captain` actor states bypass player binding and call
`PlaybookPorts.callCaptain`; the linker shall not synthesize a player id named
`captain` for them.

For composite players declared with aliases (e.g., `Committer = Coder | Reviewer`), the linker shall resolve the alias **per source item**.
Resolution inspects the `PlayerInput` fields populated at that state:

- If only one `<playerName>Player` field is present, bind to that player.
- If multiple are present, prefer the first-listed alternative in the alias declaration order.
- If none are present, fall back to the alias's first alternative.

Resolution shall be deterministic and recorded in the emitted module so future maintainers can audit it without re-running the linker.

The linker shall not invent player identifiers beyond the recorded default
binding, and shall not silently collapse aliases at the FSM level — composite
players keep their `player: 'Committer'` value on `PlayerInput`; resolution
decides only the `callPlayer` invocation.

## Player prompt composition

The runtime shall compose the actual player prompt from the state's
`PlayerInput`.
`input.prompt` is the GEARS-derived domain prompt body and shall not be mutated, re-flowed, or treated as a place to store framework control instructions.

The composer may prepend structured labelled blocks from typed `PlayerInput`
fields the FSM exposes (for example `Boss intent:`, `Review items:`,
`Rebuttals:`, or `Task description:`).
Those blocks are outside the domain prompt body.

The composer shall not inject a player-visible Boss-question instruction.
Boss-question detection is adjudicator-facing: it comes from the state's `needsBossReply` result description, not from extra prompt text.

When `PlayerInput` carries both `pendingBossQuestion` and `bossReply`, the
composer shall prepend the continuation preamble and labelled Q&A blocks before
ordinary structured blocks and before the domain prompt body:

```text
You previously paused this task to ask Boss a question; Boss has now replied. Continue the same task using the reply below.

Boss question:
<pendingBossQuestion.question>

Boss reply:
<bossReply>

```

The continuation preamble is framework text supplied by the runtime.
It is not part of the GEARS blockquote and shall not appear in `invoke.input.prompt`.
The composer shall retain the blank line after the Boss reply before the next
structured block or domain prompt, producing exactly two newline characters at
that boundary.
When implementing the prefix as an array joined with `"\n"`, the array needs
two trailing empty strings after `bossReply`; one trailing empty string emits
only one newline and is nonconformant. Equivalently, append `"\n\n"` exactly
once before the following block or domain body.

## Captain prompt composition

The runtime shall compose a direct Captain prompt from the state's
`CaptainInput` under the same prompt-integrity rules: `input.prompt` remains the
verbatim GEARS domain body, while specific typed fields may be supplied as
labelled blocks and substituted for their declared placeholders.
It shall not introduce a player binding or player resume instruction.
String fields substitute verbatim. Arrays and objects such as the sanitized
enabled-playbook catalog, remaining plan, and completed child results shall be
validated as JSON-safe and rendered as deterministic JSON; they shall never be
coerced through default JavaScript string conversion or expose untyped context.
Deterministic rendering shall sort object keys lexicographically at every
depth while preserving array order, so equivalent JSON values produce the same
prompt independent of host property insertion order.
At construction, a structured host-owned catalog shall be validated against its
declared exact entry shape, copied, and frozen recursively so later caller
mutation or extra properties cannot alter a prompt or machine decision.
For the default Captain catalog, every entry has exactly the own enumerable
data keys `id`, `command`, and `intent`; all three values are non-empty strings,
and `id` values are unique. Empty values, duplicate ids, extra keys, accessors,
non-plain objects, and non-JSON data reject runtime construction rather than
being silently repaired or discarded.

When a direct Captain task resumes from its own Boss question, the composer
shall prepend the same continuation preamble and labelled Q&A blocks defined in
§Player prompt composition. The runtime shall pass the complete composed prompt
once to `callCaptain` with `{ visibility: 'visible', resume: false }` and the
same source-owned tool restriction as the originating call; it shall not
expose the
subsequent adjudicator prompt or structured judge reply through that visible
call.
The composed prompt shall contain only the GEARS blockquote, typed runtime
evidence blocks, and the continuation preamble.
It shall not append the state's result map, guard names, result-property
schema, adjudication request, workspace context, or tool instructions.
The shared Captain composer shall replace every known placeholder whose
matching typed field is present in the supplied input. It shall not choose one
exclusive replacement set from `stateId`, source-item identity, or another
variant discriminator. Verification may deliberately combine catalog,
intent, plan, result, question, and reply fields in one synthetic input; every
matching placeholder in that template still has to be rendered.
Construct the replacement table from field presence alone. In particular,
populate `<remaining-plan>` when `remainingPlan` is supplied and
`<completed-call-results>` when `completedCallResults` is supplied, regardless
of the input's `stateId` or `sourceItem`. An implementation branch such as
`if (input.stateId === 'reassessment')` around either replacement is
nonconformant.

## Boss-event mapping

The FSM's `events` union enumerates every Boss-originated event.
The runtime receives Boss input as a free-form string
(`handleBossInput.text`).
Where the current ready or reconstructed terminal machine accepts exactly one
ordinary textual entry event and no Boss question is pending, the runtime
shall send that event deterministically and attach the exact original text to
its declared textual payload field without invoking `callJudge`.
The default Captain's ready entry is
`{ type: 'BOSS_INTENT', bossIntent: turn.text }`.
All other non-empty turns shall use `callJudge` only to choose one of the FSM's
event kinds and non-text routing fields, or no FSM action.
The classifier prompt shall include the exact, unmodified `turn.text` in a
clearly labelled Boss-message block so the judge can make that choice. Omitting
the message makes a parked-state classifier unable to distinguish an answer,
a fresh directive, and no action; including it does not authorize the judge to
rewrite the runtime-owned textual payload fields.
For `BOSS_INTENT` and `BOSS_INTERRUPT`, the runtime shall attach the exact
original text as `bossIntent`; for `BOSS_REPLY`, it shall attach the exact
original text as `answer`.
The classifier prompt shall neither request nor accept a copy of those fields,
and classifier-authored paraphrases shall never become machine context.
Empty or whitespace-only text produces no event, judge call, Captain call,
player call, status emission, or FSM transition; its received and settled
session-trace events are still emitted.

The classifier prompt shall demand JSON against the FSM's typed event union and any state-specific Boss input contract, including non-text routing payload fields required for each event but excluding the runtime-owned textual fields above.
Fields the FSM's event union declares optional shall stay optional in the classifier contract and the reply parser; the classifier shall not promote them to required.
The runtime shall parse the judge reply tolerantly before validating the
event. It shall recover the intended JSON object from surrounding prose or a
Markdown fence, ignore earlier non-JSON bracketed prose, remove a trailing
comma before a closing brace or bracket, and complete a truncated
unterminated string or unclosed object/array. When several values are
recoverable, it shall choose the first object in document order, preferring a
strict parse at each candidate position before repairing that same candidate.
For each opening-brace position, first scan strings and nesting to find that
candidate's earliest balanced closing boundary. Both the strict parse and the
trailing-comma repair shall operate on only that bounded substring. If no
closing boundary exists, repair may complete the unterminated suffix. The
implementation shall never repair the entire remaining document after a
balanced candidate, because later prose or a later clean object would make the
earlier repair fail. Advance to the next opening brace only after strict and
repaired parsing of the current bounded candidate both fail; an earlier
repairable object therefore wins over every later strict object.
When no object is recoverable or the recovered event/payload is invalid, the
runtime shall emit exactly one status and send no FSM event; a malformed
classification is recoverable control input, not a public boundary rejection.
If a recovered `BOSS_REPLY` names no question that is currently pending, it is
such a malformed classification: emit the one recovery status, send no event,
leave the actor unchanged, and return `no-action` after emissions drain.
Host-owned runtime options, player bindings, and enabled-playbook catalogs are
not Boss-event payload. The classifier schema and parser shall not invite or
accept them, and classified prose shall never overwrite their machine context.
Every recovered classifier object shall have exactly `type` plus the declared
non-text routing keys for its selected event arm. Extra own keys, including a
classifier-authored `bossIntent` or `answer`, reject the classification; the
parser shall not accept and discard injected catalog, option, state, or
routing fields.
`NO_ACTION` in particular is exactly `{ type: 'NO_ACTION' }`.
A valid `NO_ACTION` returns `no-action` without an invalid-classification
status and leaves the actor untouched. It is a successful classifier choice,
not the same parser result as malformed or unrecoverable classifier output.
After any successful classifier call drains, re-check the active Boss signal
before reconstructing a terminal actor or sending the selected event. If it
aborted while the classifier finish emission was pending, return and trace the
same structured `aborted` result against the unchanged actor.
When the FSM supports a Boss-reply suspension state, the prompt shall inspect
the actor snapshot context and include each exact pending Boss question,
question id, and asking player so the judge can distinguish a reply from a
fresh directive. With one pending question, a classified `BOSS_REPLY` that
omits its optional id shall be filled with that sole id. With several pending
questions, the classifier shall require a known id. A reply shall re-enter only
its recorded resume state and preserve the original intent, plan, prior child
results, and Q+A continuation context.
The classifier-facing pending-question block contains only `questionId`,
`player`, and `question`. Internal `resumeStateId`, source-item identity, and
other machine-routing fields remain authoritative in snapshot context and
shall not be serialized into the judge prompt.
The allowed fresh directives while parked include every applicable root entry
event and `BOSS_INTERRUPT`; accepting one shall abandon and clear the pending
question and reply context before new work begins.

A playbook runtime shall not define slash-prefix commands for states or features inside that playbook.
The `/command` namespace is reserved for host-level or playbook-selection UX before a turn reaches `handleBossInput`.
If a host forwards text beginning with `/` to `handleBossInput`, the runtime treats it as ordinary Boss text and maps it through the same deterministic-or-classified Boss-event rules.

Hosts that receive structured control input shall resolve host-level concerns before choosing a playbook runtime.
Once they call `handleBossInput`, they shall pass the Boss content as text and shall not pre-classify in-playbook FSM events or rely on slash forms as a runtime protocol.

`BOSS_INTERRUPT` (or the FSM's equivalent explicit-state-jump event) is reached only by the judge choosing it and supplying its required target payload.
It is _not_ an abort surface; aborts go through the abort signal and the strategies in §Abort.
Hosts where the abort signal is terminal (e.g., SIGINT runs shutdown) shall not route abort to `BOSS_INTERRUPT`.

## Captain adjudication

After a direct Captain or delegated player call returns, the runtime shall
coerce `result.finalText` into one of the **per-state**
`invoke.input.result` keys.
It shall also extract any payload fields the state's `result` description names as required.
Required-field extraction shall recognize both an exact backticked property
name such as `` `question` `` and the standard annotated form
`` `question: <verbatim question text>` ``; in either form only `question` is
the JSON property name.
Extraction is limited to the description's explicit `Output shall include`
clause (or equivalent typed output metadata). Backticked prose before that
clause can name statuses, guards, or concepts such as `ok`, `aborted`, and
`error`; those names are not output properties and shall never become required
judge fields.
For a direct Captain result, `question` and `response` are human-presentation
fields owned by the visible call rather than fields authored by the hidden
judge.
The adjudicator shall select the guard and supply only other structural fields
required by that guard.
After validating that selection, the runtime shall inject the exact non-empty
`CaptainResult.finalText` as the selected output's `question` or `response`.
It shall reject a judge reply that supplies either presentation field as an
undeclared extra key, so hidden adjudication cannot replace, paraphrase, or
decorate prose Boss already saw.
Delegated-player adjudication retains extraction of every required field from
the judge reply, including a player-authored Boss question.
The adjudicator shall use the same document-order tolerant JSON recovery as
the Boss classifier. Unlike invalid classification, a reply from which no
object can be recovered, an undeclared guard, or a missing required field is a
control-plane error and shall throw after the invocation reaches its FSM error
path and ordered emissions drain.

Two default adjudication strategies, in selection order:

- **LLM-judge** (default): construct a fresh prompt for `callJudge` that
  names the source item's actor (and delegated player where applicable),
  includes the actor's verbatim output,
  lists the `result` keys with their descriptions, and demands a JSON
  `{ guard, …structuralPayloadFields }` answer keyed to exactly one of the
  declared guards, excluding the runtime-owned direct-Captain `question` and
  `response` fields above. The judge prompt shall not interpret the player's
  output, paraphrase it, or alter the FSM's `result` text — it carries
  the description verbatim.
- **Marker-parse** (delegated-player alternative): a deterministic parser that
  scans the player output for a terminal control line such as
  `FSM-RESULT: { "guard": "...", ... }`. Useful when player adapters can
  be steered to emit structured trailers and the operator wants to avoid
  the extra LLM call.

The linker may select different strategies per delegated-player state; the
default is **LLM-judge for every state**. Direct-Captain states shall use the
LLM judge so their visible prose remains human-readable and carries no marker
or control JSON. Their adjudicator call uses purpose
`captain-output-adjudication` and remains hidden at the host adapter.

When the direct Captain result selects a terminal `response`, the exact
already-visible `CaptainResult.finalText` is the machine response and Boss
presentation. The linked
runtime shall not make a second visible Captain call or expose the hidden
structured adjudication merely to present the same response.

The adjudicator shall fail loudly on:

- A guard the state does not declare,
- A missing payload field the state's `result` description requires,
- An empty / malformed response.

These cases shall remain distinguishable in the thrown error: malformed JSON
recovery shall identify the missing JSON object, an unknown selection shall
identify an undeclared guard, and an incomplete selection shall identify the
missing required field. A generic “no declared guard selected” error for all
three cases is nonconformant.

Adjudicator failures are control-plane errors.
The runtime shall propagate them by throwing out of `handleBossInput` after attempting cleanup.
The host adapter surfaces the throw on its control-plane channel (cligent surfaces such throws as `runtime_error` per [TMUX-025](https://github.com/sublang-ai/cligent/blob/main/specs/user/tmux-play.md#tmux-025)).
The host's player-result channels (`player_finished` and equivalents) are reserved for failures the player itself produced; the host emits them when `callPlayer` resolves with `status !== 'ok'`.
Captain call failures stay on the Captain/control boundary and shall not be
reported as player failures.
Because XState still needs the invoked promise to settle, the linked runtime
shall latch an adjudicator, actor-output JSON-validation, or nested-boundary
control error outside machine context, allow the invocation's `onError` path to
reach quiescence, drain all emissions, and then reject the public runtime
method with that original error. It shall not return such a failure as a
recoverable `{ outcome: 'failed' }` workflow result.
The first latched non-abort control error takes precedence over a coincident
boundary-signal abort. Read and clear the latch only in the public boundary's
`finally` cleanup after XState and emissions have settled, so it cannot leak
into a later Boss turn or be erased before rejection.
An `AbortError`-named transport, validation, or trace-sink failure is still a
non-abort control error unless it is causally identical to the applicable
signal reason. Error names shall never change original-error or first-latch
precedence.
When a host port or structured-result validator fails after a call-start
boundary, latch that original error before attempting the required finish
trace. If the finish sink records the event and then rejects, do not emit a
second finish and do not let the sink failure replace the earlier control
error returned by the public boundary; retain the sink failure only as
independent cleanup evidence.

## Script execution

Where the FSM declares the typed `script` actor from
[gears2fsm "Setup"](gears2fsm.md#setup), the linker shall provide its
implementation inside the emitted module.
A script invocation is the one actor kind that runs without any agent:
it makes no `callPlayer`, `callCaptain`, or `callJudge` call and needs no
adjudication.

The provided actor shall:

- Execute `input.command` verbatim through the platform's POSIX shell
  (`sh -c`), with the working directory taken from the emitted
  `PlaybookRuntimeOptions.cwd` when the caller supplies it, else the process
  working directory. The linker shall declare the optional `cwd` option on the
  emitted options interface whenever the FSM contains a script state.
- Resolve deterministically from the child's exit status: status zero resolves
  `{ guard: <first declared guard>, exitStatus: 0 }`; any nonzero status
  resolves the second declared guard with that status. Guard selection is
  mechanical; the runtime shall not route script output through the judge.
- Reject only when the command cannot be spawned at all, routing through the
  state's ordinary `onError` path.
- Honor the active turn's abort signal by terminating the child process and
  rejecting per §Abort.
- Emit, after the child settles and before the invocation resolves, one status
  line `Executed script for <stateId> (exit <status>).` and one telemetry
  event under topic `playbook.script` with payload
  `{ stateId, sourceItem, exitStatus }`, through the ordinary serialized
  emission channel.

Script execution emits no `*.call.*` trace pair: the surrounding FSM
transition trace and the `playbook.script` telemetry are its record, so trace
schema consumers see no new event types.
Script stdout and stderr are not workflow data: the runtime shall not place
them in machine context, prompts, or trace payloads.

## Nested playbook bridge

Where the FSM declares the typed `playbook` actor from
[gears2fsm](gears2fsm.md#nested-playbook-calls), the linked runtime shall provide
it with the shared `createNestedPlaybookBridge(...).actorLogic`; it shall not
regenerate a second pending-call, identity-validation, or abort-cleanup
substrate inside each linked artifact.
Instantiate the generic bridge with the FSM-exported `PlaybookInput` type so
XState `.provide(...)` receives the exact declared actor input rather than a
structurally similar local type.
Construct one bridge per runtime and wire every integration hook: allocate ids
with `nextCallId`; return the currently active public-boundary signal from
`getBoundarySignal`; bind `resumePlaybookCall.signal` before settling the
deferred actor through `bindResumeSignal`; enqueue the exact start/finish trace
through `emitStarted` / `emitFinished`; drain the global emission queue through
`drain`; latch the original control error through `onControlPlaneError`; and
retain any cleanup/observer failure through `onBackgroundError` for the next
public boundary or disposal rejection. The runtime shall not leave these
optional API hooks unwired merely because their TypeScript properties are
optional for simpler bridge consumers.
On invocation the bridge allocates a runtime-local call id, traces the start,
and calls `PlaybookPorts.callPlaybook` with the composed target/text and the
bridge signal combined from the XState invocation lifetime, the active public
boundary, and the bridge's own disposal controller.

For a literal invocation, target and text retain their existing static/composed
values. For a dynamic invocation, the bridge shall use the evaluated
`PlaybookInput.playbookId` and `PlaybookInput.text` values, require both to be
strings with non-empty target and text, and preserve the exact resolved values in the
request and trace. The linker shall preserve the FSM's static
`playbookIdContext` and `textContext` metadata for conformance; it shall not
parse function source, treat either metadata name as the runtime value, or
freeze a dynamic call to the value observed during artifact inspection.

If the port returns `state: 'settled'`, the bridge validates the result,
emits and drains `playbook.call.finished`, then resolves successful output or
rejects an aborted/error result.
If the port returns `state: 'suspended'`, the bridge records one pending call
and awaits a runtime-owned deferred result.
Only after that pending record exists may the drive boundary treat the call
state's `playbook.suspended` tag as quiescent.
One runtime supports at most one pending child call; a second shall reject.
The pending record shall also retain the call-start `turnId`. A resumed finish
and every parent transition, Captain reassessment, and status caused by that
return shall use this retained id, not an absent or newly allocated
current-turn value. The finish callback shall receive or close over that stored
id rather than read a mutable global turn id at resume time.
The bridge shall strictly validate the start discriminant, non-empty suspended
child session id, settled target identity, optional state descriptor,
normalized error, and JSON-safe output. A malformed start, malformed result,
identity mismatch, or non-JSON value is a control-plane error. Once a start
trace exists, every thrown port, validation failure, immediate result,
suspension resume, invocation abort, and disposal path shall emit and drain
exactly one matching finish trace; malformed data shall neither create a
pending identity nor be reassessed as ordinary child evidence.
The bridge shall detach and recursively freeze a validated start/result before
tracing it or delivering it to the FSM, so caller mutation after port
resolution cannot alter identity, evidence, or trace payloads. A non-abort
`callPlaybook` throw/rejection is a control-plane failure: pair its finish,
latch and rethrow the original error, and take the FSM fallback error path. A
rejection caused by the combined abort signal remains an authored `aborted`
child result.
The optional output field may be absent from an otherwise valid successful
child result. Generated event and trace descriptors shall omit an absent or
`undefined` output instead of attempting to snapshot it as a JSON value.
When cancellation wins while the host's opening promise is still pending, the
shared bridge shall retain and drain that exact promise before emitting the
matching finish boundary. It shall ignore an abort-reason rejection from that
opening promise, surface any other late rejection as a control-plane cleanup
failure, and recover a child session identity from a late resolved start when
available. Generated runtimes shall pass the host port directly to the shared
bridge rather than recreate this opening-promise drainage locally.
In particular, aborting a public turn during that opening promise shall abort
the combined bridge signal, wait for opening cleanup and the paired finish,
let the promise actor reach its `onError` quiescent state, and only then return
an aborted run result. It shall neither hang waiting for a child-resume path
that was never registered nor return while the opening promise or finish
emission remains live.
The pending record shall retain a one-shot invocation-signal listener. If the
call state is stopped, that listener shall settle and clear the deferred call
as an aborted `NestedPlaybookCallError`, drain the matching finish boundary after
host abort cleanup, and make a later nested invocation possible; it shall not
leave a permanently pending record merely because XState stopped observing the
promise actor.

`resumePlaybookCall` shall accept only the matching pending call id, target
playbook id, and child session id; bind its new turn signal for work resumed in
the parent; emit and drain the call-finish trace; settle the bridge deferred;
and use XState `waitFor` to drive the parent to its next
quiescent, suspended, failed, aborted, or terminal result.
An `ok` result resolves the actor and reaches `invoke.onDone`; `aborted` and
`error` results reject it and reach `invoke.onError`.
The rejection shall be an `Error` whose public readonly `result` property is
the exact normalized `PlaybookCallResult`; throwing the result object directly
or discarding its status prevents the FSM from distinguishing abort from
failure during recovery.
Unknown, duplicate, or stale call ids reject without changing actor state.
The finish trace shall therefore precede any parent FSM transition caused by
the child return.
The host independently validates every evaluated target against its enabled
registry; linker-time metadata is not authorization to call a target.

Disposal shall settle an outstanding call as aborted and drain its finish
trace before `session.disposed`.
If registered child abort cleanup rejects, the bridge shall emit the paired
finish with an error result and reject `abortPending` or disposal with that
original cleanup error; it shall not swallow the failure merely because the
promise actor also observes a `NestedPlaybookCallError`. Parent disposal shall
still drain, emit its one `session.disposed` boundary, and clear the bound
session before rejecting with that preserved cleanup error.
Child output and errors must be JSON-safe; a non-JSON-safe result is a
control-plane error.

## Session lifecycle

The `PlaybookRuntime` shall:

- Reject use before `init`, a second active turn or resume, and re-initializing
  a live session. `handleBossInput` and `resumePlaybookCall` share one active
  turn sentinel; neither may overlap the other, and disposal shall not race a
  live boundary. A dispose request made during an active public boundary shall
  reject without beginning teardown. Idle concurrent dispose requests shall
  share one disposal promise; later calls after disposal shall return that
  settled disposal outcome without emitting another boundary. Once disposal
  begins, no new turn or resume may start.
  Disposal requested during initialization shall retain one teardown promise,
  wait for initialization's success or failure cleanup, and emit at most one
  `session.disposed` boundary. Disposal before initialization is terminal and
  coalesced: later initialization rejects and every later disposal call
  returns the first retained promise.
  Represent in-flight initialization with a cleanup-complete latch resolved by
  `init`'s outer `finally`, after either successful startup or the complete
  failed-start cleanup. Do not expose the fallible inner startup promise as
  that latch: it rejects before the outer cleanup and lets concurrent disposal
  race the cleanup's own `session.disposed` attempt.
  Put session validation and snapshotting, bridge/actor construction, initial
  state reads, and startup emissions inside that guarded outer `try`; none may
  throw before the cleanup-complete latch's `finally` can resolve. A rejected
  session identity must not leave later disposal waiting forever.
  The generated `dispose` method shall not be declared `async`, because an
  async wrapper returns a distinct promise and breaks identity coalescing; it
  shall return the retained teardown promise directly and use
  `Promise.reject(...)` for precondition failures.

- In `init`, bind the immutable `PlaybookSession`, emit
  `session.started` with the initial normalized state descriptor, and
  construct the XState actor with FSM `input` derived
  from `options`. The actor is session-scoped, not turn-scoped. Use XState v5's
  public actor inspection `@xstate.snapshot` event for the root actor so each
  transition's triggering event and snapshot can be surfaced via `emitStatus`
  and `emitTelemetry` before the next event fires; do not consult private actor
  nodes or infer the event later from context. Filter inspection events by
  `inspectionEvent.actorRef === rootActor`, not merely by the actor-system root
  id, so promise-child snapshots are not emitted as root FSM transitions. The
  inspection callback shall only validate and synchronously enqueue emission
  work, catching validation/enqueue failures into the control/background-error
  latch; it shall not let an exception escape or call an async port directly.
  Its transition `event` field shall be a detached JSON-safe descriptor, never
  the raw XState inspection event. Preserve the string `type` (or use
  `unknown` when absent); copy only declared Boss-union payload fields and a
  validated actor `output`, and normalize an `error` member before inclusion.
  Omit `input`, `actorId`, system/ref data, and every other XState-internal
  field even when it happens to be JSON-safe, so `xstate.init.input` cannot
  leak the host catalog into transition telemetry. In particular, do not call
  `snapshotJsonValue(event)` on an `xstate.error.actor.*` event that contains a
  raw `Error`.
  Construct the actor without starting it, read its public initial snapshot,
  emit and drain `session.started`, and only then call `actor.start()`. The
  initial inspection-driven transition/status emissions shall not precede the
  session-start trace. Have any actor-construction helper return the actor and
  assign it at the call site; TypeScript does not narrow a captured optional
  actor variable from assignment hidden inside a helper. Retain a non-optional
  local actor reference across terminal reconstruction and event sending.
  An actor-construction helper may read the already-bound immutable session
  directly for machine input such as `session.playbookId`, but it shall not
  call a lifecycle assertion that also requires the actor to exist. The actor
  does not exist until that helper returns, so coupling session access to actor
  availability makes every valid `init` fail before construction completes.
  Generated code shall pass the repository's full strict `tsc` build with no
  unused helper or destructured parameter, not only a transpile-only or
  target-local syntax check.
  For the default Captain runtime, the initial quiescent `ready` snapshot may
  emit the ordinary structured transition trace and telemetry, but it is not a
  Boss-relevant transition and shall emit no human status. Any initial
  transition-trace or telemetry sink failure is part of `init`: initialization
  shall reject, stop the actor, and perform the failed-start cleanup below
  rather than swallowing it as a later background error.
  Where the FSM input declares `selfPlaybookId`, seed it from the immutable
  `session.playbookId`; do not expose a caller option or reuse a working leaf's
  `stateId` as the self-call identity.
- If initialization fails after attempting `session.started`, stop the actor,
  abort/drain nested and host work, and make one best-effort
  `session.disposed` attempt before clearing the bound session. Preserve the
  original initialization error if cleanup or disposal emission also fails.
  Suppress root inspection emissions before stopping the failed actor because
  XState emits a stop snapshot; that teardown snapshot shall not retry a
  transition/status sink that already failed initialization. Reset the
  inspection gate, queues, error latches, prior state, and all per-session
  sequence counters so a permitted retry starts with trace sequence `1`.
- Per `handleBossInput`:
  1. Allocate a runtime-local turn id and trace the exact Boss text.
  2. Map `turn.text` through the Boss-event mapping, using deterministic exact
     entry where applicable and classification otherwise.
     If mapping produces no event, return after draining any port emissions.
     If the classifier port rejects, emit and drain the Boss-settled error
     boundary, send no event, leave the actor unchanged (including a terminal
     actor), and reject the original error. If that rejection is caused by the
     active Boss abort signal, return and trace the same structured `aborted`
     result instead of tracing `no-action`. If the port resolves but its reply
     cannot be recovered or validated, emit the one recovery status required
     by §Boss-event mapping, send no event, leave the actor unchanged, and
     return `no-action` after the ordinary settled boundary drains.
  3. Only after classification produces a real event, if the actor is in a
     `final` state, dispose and reconstruct it — `final` is terminal and cannot
     accept new events. `NO_ACTION`, classifier rejection, and malformed
     classification shall leave a terminal actor untouched.
  4. Bind the active public-boundary signal and send the classified event to
     the actor.
  5. **Drive to quiescence**: provide each invoked actor according to its
     declared kind. For `player`, build a player prompt, call `callPlayer`,
     adjudicate, and resolve the invoke. For `captain`, build a direct Captain
     prompt, call `callCaptain` visibly, adjudicate through the shared hidden
     judge path, and resolve the invoke. For `playbook`, use §Nested playbook
     bridge. For `script`, use §Script execution — no port call and no
     adjudication. Parallel regions may run distinct resolved players independently;
     Captain and judge work remains serialized by the shared host queue. Use
     XState `waitFor` over public tags/status until no `playbook.busy` state is
     active, a registered child call is suspended, or the actor is
     terminal/error. Pass `pendingCalls: nestedBridge` so a suspended tag is
     quiescent only after its child identity exists. Under natural rejection,
     do not pass the already-aborted public turn signal as wait cancellation:
     it has already been combined into the invoked boundary, and the runtime
     must now wait for XState's `onError` transition and quiescence.
  6. Return a structured `PlaybookRunResult` after all in-flight calls and
     ordered emissions caused by the turn drain.
- Per `resumePlaybookCall`, follow §Nested playbook bridge and return the same
  structured run-result boundary without classifying new Boss text. Drain the
  transition/status/telemetry queue before returning, just as
  `handleBossInput` does. A resume shall not allocate a new Boss-input
  `turnId`; retain the original call-start turn id for its matching finish and
  for the parent continuation caused by that return. Every success and
  exceptional path shall drain ordered emissions, select the first latched
  non-abort control error before considering abort, and clear its boundary
  latches in `finally`, so a failed resume cannot leak an emission error into a
  later turn.
  A resume is not a Boss-input turn and shall emit neither
  `boss.input.received` nor `boss.input.settled`; the structured result is the
  method return. Reusing the originating turn id on the child finish and
  continuation emissions does not create a second Boss trace pair.
  This quiescence and drain path is mandatory even when
  `nestedBridge.resume(...)` rejects: capture that operation error, allow the
  promise actor's `onError` transition to settle, and select the first latched
  control error only after all ordered emissions have drained.
- In `dispose`, capture the final public state and stop the root actor before
  settling or aborting a suspended nested bridge, so the bridge rejection
  cannot reenter the FSM and start new actor work during disposal. Then drain
  pending port emissions and every in-flight Captain/player/judge/child opening, emit
  `session.disposed` with the final descriptor, and discard player resume
  tokens. Host child abort cleanup and child `session.disposed` shall drain
  before the parent call finish, which shall drain before parent
  `session.disposed`. Use cleanup/finally structure so a bridge or emission
  failure cannot skip the parent disposal boundary or leave the runtime bound.

The actor's `lastError` field shall be surfaced via `emitStatus` when the machine enters its `failed` state.
For the default Captain runtime, an initial `ready` state and a terminal `done`
state shall not emit human status. The terminal response is already visible
Captain prose; a synthetic “entered done” message would present it twice.
Structured transition trace and telemetry still apply to both states.
Every provided actor boundary shall first drain the queued state-entry
transition/status/telemetry caused by entering its working leaf, so a call's
`*.started` trace cannot overtake the transition that explains it. Every public
runtime method shall drain that queue before it resolves or rejects.
This initial `await drain()` is required inside each provided `fromPromise`
body: XState may begin that body before publishing the root snapshot, and the
await yields so the synchronous inspection callback can enqueue the entering
transition first.

If a `*.call.started` trace records and then its sink rejects, no host call may
begin. The runtime shall still enqueue exactly one synthetic paired
`*.call.finished` trace with `status: 'error'`, preserving the original call
id, turn id, actor visibility, state/source identity, and prompt or request
metadata from the start boundary. It shall then follow the same latched
control-error, FSM settlement, and ordered-drain path as any other call-start
failure; the synthetic finish must not replace the original sink error.

## Parked-session snapshot (optional)

A linked runtime may implement the optional durable-session capability of
`@sublang/playbook/runtime` — `exportSnapshot()` and
`restore(session, snapshot)` — so a host can persist a parked session and
rehydrate it in a later process (DR-014). A runtime that implements either
member shall implement both. When generated for a runtime whose host needs
durability, the pair shall behave as follows.

`exportSnapshot()` shall return `undefined` unless the runtime is at a safe
capture point: initialized, not disposing or disposed, no active
`handleBossInput`/`resumePlaybookCall` boundary, no pending nested playbook
call, and the root actor at a quiescent state with actor status `active`.
At a safe capture point it shall return a JSON-safe
`PlaybookRuntimeSnapshot` carrying:

- `schemaVersion`: literal `1`.
- `playbookId`: the bound session's playbook id.
- `machine`: the root actor's `getPersistedSnapshot()` result, passed
  through the shared JSON detachment with any raw `Error` context value
  (for example FSM `lastError`) normalized to `{ name, message, stack? }`
  first. The value is opaque to hosts.
- `playerResumeTokens`: the resume-token map as a plain object
  (§PlaybookPorts contract).
- `sequences`: the live `trace`, `turn`, `judgeCall`, `playerCall`, and
  `playbookCall` counters.
- `state`: the current normalized state descriptor.
- `pendingBossQuestions`: the pending Boss question(s) from FSM context as
  a list of `{ questionId, player, question, sourceItem? }`, empty when the
  parked state awaits no reply. This list exists so hosts can surface the
  question without parsing status lines or telemetry.

`restore(session, snapshot)` is an alternative to `init` under the same
lifecycle guards (§Session lifecycle): it shall reject when already
initialized, disposing, or disposed, and shall validate
`snapshot.schemaVersion` and that `snapshot.playbookId` equals
`session.playbookId` before touching state.
The host supplies the same immutable `PlaybookSession` identity the
snapshot was exported under and recreates the runtime through the same
factory with equivalent options; the runtime does not diff options, and
module identity — that the factory constructing this runtime still
belongs to the snapshot's playbook — is likewise the host's check to
make before calling `restore`.
`restore` shall bind the session, restore the resume-token map, the
sequence counters, and the prior-state descriptor from the snapshot,
construct the actor with the persisted `machine` snapshot, and start it
with root inspection emissions suppressed so rehydration emits no
`session.started` trace, no transition trace, and no human status — the
session already started, and the next public boundary continues the
contiguous trace sequence. After start, a restored actor whose status is
not `active` or whose state descriptor cannot be normalized shall fail
`restore` through the same failed-start cleanup path as `init`.
A restore failure shall leave the runtime unbound so `dispose` remains
callable and terminal.

## Abort

`handleBossInput.signal` is the abort surface.
The runtime shall honor it at every `callPlayer`/`callCaptain`/`callJudge` and
at every poll between transitions.
Each provided Captain, player, judge, or nested-playbook boundary shall receive
a signal combined from its XState invocation-lifetime signal and the currently
active `handleBossInput` or `resumePlaybookCall` signal (for example with
the shared `combineAbortSignals`). Classify a rejection as cancellation by its
causal identity with the applicable signal reason, not by an `AbortError` name
or by observing only that the signal is also aborted. Signals may carry an
ordinary `Error`, while a distinct transport or sink failure that occurs after
abort remains a non-abort control error and takes precedence. On abort, the
runtime shall not merely race the imperative
wait and return while an invocation remains live: it shall let the selected
rejection path settle and drive the actor to a quiescent state before returning
from the turn. No trace, status, state, or call completion caused by that turn
may appear after the public method returns.
Three strategies are permitted; the linker selects per FSM:

- **Natural rejection** — the runtime's Captain or player actor (e.g.,
  `fromPromise`) ends the invocation by rejecting, and the FSM routes
  the rejection through `onError` to a quiescent sink. The cancelled
  port call may _itself_ reject, or it may resolve with
  `PlayerResult` or `CaptainResult` with
  `{ status: 'aborted' | 'error' }` that the runtime
  inspects and converts into an actor rejection. Either shape
  is permitted — the contract is on the actor boundary, not on
  the port's promise behavior. Preferred when every Captain- or player-invoking
  state's `onError` lands somewhere quiescent; the FSM's own error
  wiring is the abort path.
- **Synthetic pre-emption to a quiescent target** — send the FSM's
  pre-emption event (e.g., `BOSS_INTERRUPT { targetId: <state> }`) with
  a target that is itself quiescent (typically `ready` or `failed`).
  The runtime shall not pick the active state as the target:
  `gears2fsm.md` prescribes `reenter: true` for `bossInterrupts`, so
  re-entering the active state restarts its `invoke` and spawns a
  fresh agent call.
- **Programmatic stop** — `actor.stop()` and report the turn as aborted
  via `emitStatus`. Reserved for FSMs with neither `onError` wiring nor
  a pre-emption event.

Whether the host's outer abort (e.g., SIGINT) is recoverable or terminal is the host's concern.
The runtime exits `handleBossInput` cleanly in either case; the host decides whether to call `dispose` afterward.

## Status and telemetry

The runtime shall emit, at minimum:

- One `emitStatus` per Boss-relevant transition (entering a state whose
  semantics matter to Boss — e.g., `respondToReview`, `failed`). The
  default is to emit on every transition and let the host filter; hosts
  may bind a stricter rule.
- One `emitTelemetry` per state transition under a namespaced topic
  (recommended `playbook.fsm.state`), with structured `from`, `to`, `event`,
  `previousState`, and `state` fields. Descriptors carry the JSON-safe XState
  value, active stable ids from public state metadata, tags, status, and
  quiescence; they do not inspect private XState nodes.
  The payload shall additionally carry the exact pending Boss question or
  keyed questions selected from public snapshot context and normalize any
  transition error without retaining a raw `Error` instance.
  Do not reduce this payload to the current state: `from` and `previousState`
  are the authoritative prior descriptor, while `to` and `state` are the new
  descriptor. On the first observed transition, use the initialized state as
  both the prior and new descriptor when no earlier transition exists.
  Snapshot and recursively freeze the complete described telemetry payload
  independently from the state retained as `previousState`, so an observer
  cannot mutate a later transition's authoritative `from` state.
  Observers consume telemetry; the runtime never interprets the topic.

Player prompts and adjudicator JSON may additionally ride the host's own record channels when the host has them (cligent's `captain_*` / `player_*`).
The `playbook.trace` copies are the host-agnostic runtime-boundary record required by §Playbook trace.

## Output

The link compiler emits **one** TypeScript module that:

- Imports the FSM artifact by relative path with an extension-bearing
  runtime specifier. When the linked TypeScript is part of a package that
  compiles and ships JavaScript siblings, the source shall use the
  NodeNext-compatible `.js` specifier (for example `./code.fsm.js`), never a
  `.ts` specifier that the package's supported Node versions cannot load.
  An explicitly source-only host may instead retain `.ts` only when that
  host supports direct TypeScript loading and no JavaScript build is shipped.
- Restricts itself to erasable TypeScript syntax — type annotations
  that strip cleanly, no constructor parameter properties, `enum`s, or
  namespaces — so a host running under type stripping loads it
  directly.
- Imports XState's actor primitives (`createActor`, `fromPromise`,
  `setup`'s `.provide`).
- Imports `PQueue` from `p-queue` for its single serialized emission channel.
- Imports the FSM's exported machine/actor input and output types and uses
  those exact types in `.provide(...)`; it shall not redeclare look-alike
  Captain, player, playbook, question, or output contracts beside the linked
  runtime.
- Imports the applicable shared helpers from the extension-bearing
  `xstate-runtime.js` sibling of the resolved shared `--link` contract module,
  with that sibling path relativized from the emitted artifact exactly as the
  contract import is. Every runtime uses `assertJsonSafe`, `snapshotJsonValue`,
  `snapshotPlaybookSession`, `normalizeError`,
  `normalizePlaybookSnapshot`, and `waitForPlaybookQuiescence`; it additionally
  imports `combineAbortSignals`, result validators, and
  `createNestedPlaybookBridge` only when its actor and composition paths need
  them. It shall use those helpers instead of emitting weaker local JSON,
  error, snapshot, nested-call, or imperative-wait implementations.
- Exports `createPlaybookRuntime` and the typed `PlaybookRuntimeOptions`
  interface for that playbook.
- Exposes, under an `_internal` export, the pure helpers verification
  needs — at least the player-prompt and Captain-prompt composers
  (`composePlayerPrompt` and `composeCaptainPrompt`) — so
  compilation-correctness tests can exercise composition without a host.
- Holds no host-specific types and no host primitive calls. The runtime
  speaks only `PlaybookPorts` for every agent and host concern; the sole
  exception is `node:child_process`, imported only when the FSM declares a
  `script` actor, so §Script execution can run its deterministic commands
  locally.
- Records the linker inputs (FSM path, player binding, strategies) in a
  top-of-file header comment so the file is reproducible from the same
  inputs.
- Sources the contract types (`PlayerResult`, `PlayerCallOptions`,
  `CaptainResult`, `CaptainCallOptions`, `PlaybookPorts`, `PlaybookSession`,
  `PlaybookTraceEvent`,
  `PlaybookCallRequest`, `PlaybookCallResult`, `PlaybookCallStart`,
  `PlaybookStateValue`, `PlaybookState`, `PlaybookRunResult`,
  `PlaybookRuntime`, `PlaybookRuntimeFactory`) from a single shared
  type-only module instead of redefining them, and re-exports the names
  its consumers import, so every linked playbook shares one contract
  definition. The shared module imports no FSM or host types, so the
  dependency runs one way — from each linked module to the shared
  contract, never the reverse.

When a co-located integration test for the linked runtime already exists, the
link compiler shall run it before reporting success and treat any failure as a
generation failure. It shall not delete, skip, or weaken that suite to make a
new artifact pass; the suite is executable evidence for lifecycle, ordering,
error-propagation, and host-boundary requirements that static artifact checks
cannot establish.

Internal trace/status helpers may accept `unknown`, validate it with the same
JSON-safety rules as the public boundary, and only then emit a `JsonValue`.
They shall not require nominally typed public interfaces such as
`NormalizedError`, `PlaybookState`, `PlaybookCallRequest`, or
`PlaybookCallResult` to satisfy a `JsonValue` index signature at compile time,
and they shall not silence that mismatch with an unchecked cast.
Prompt placeholder substitution shall make one callback-based pass over the
original template. Replacement strings are literal: placeholder-looking text
inside Boss/catalog/plan/result values and JavaScript replacement tokens such
as `$&`, `$$`, dollar-backtick, and `$'` shall not be interpreted or
substituted again.

## Host adaptation (informative, not normative)

A host integrates with playbooks via a small adapter that:

1. Accepts a path to a `PlaybookRuntime` module (either as a direct
   import in a playbook-specific adapter, or via the host's config
   surface in a generic adapter).
2. Imports the module and constructs the runtime with options forwarded
   verbatim from the host config.
3. Implements `PlaybookPorts` by wrapping the host's own primitives —
   for cligent/tmux-play this is `callPlayer ← context.callPlayer`, visible
   `callCaptain ← context.callCaptain`, hidden
   `callJudge ← context.callCaptain`, nested `callPlaybook ←` the Captain
   session stack, and `emitStatus`/`emitTelemetry` ←
   `session.emitStatus`/`session.emitTelemetry`. The two Captain-backed ports
   share one abort-aware concurrency-one queue.
4. Generates a unique playbook-session id, calls
   `runtime.init({ sessionId, rootSessionId: sessionId, depth: 0,
playbookId, ports })` once at session start, forwards each Boss turn to
   `runtime.handleBossInput`, and calls
   `runtime.dispose()` at session end.

Its location is a project-organization choice:

- **Playbook repo** — simplest when the playbook author owns the integration; keeps host primitives a lower-layer dependency.
- **Host repo** — when the host author wants to ship an opt-in playbook Captain.
- **Third package** — otherwise.

This spec is silent on the choice; the contract is the same in any location.

## Out of scope

- Defining player prompts, result keys, or guard semantics — those
  belong in the GEARS source and the FSM artifact.
- Host adapter implementations, host configuration, presentation
  layouts — where these live is a per-project decision (see
  §Host adaptation); this spec only constrains the `PlaybookPorts`
  contract they satisfy.
- Trace persistence, multiple Boss-selected root engagements, recursive
  playbook calls, multi-Boss orchestration, or visualizer rendering —
  separate hosts/observers may add them without changing this spec. A host
  may persist the emitted trace, but the runtime does not rehydrate a
  disposed actor from it. Parked-session durability is in scope only
  through the optional snapshot surface of §Parked-session snapshot
  (DR-014); everything beyond it remains out of scope.

New behavior in any of these areas requires a separate slc spec.
